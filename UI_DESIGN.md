# UI Design

I'd like the UI to feel very similar to Into the Breach. Each move you can make will be highlighted to make it easier to see what you can do. Each move is previewed before confirming. You can roll back your turn until you click "End Turn".

There is a move history (like a chess move history), which you can hover over to see previous board states.

Things like abandoning a system will preview that the system will be destroyed.
