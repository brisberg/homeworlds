# Homeworlds Ruleset

Sumarized from the [offical rule set](https://www.looneylabs.com/rules/homeworlds).

## Pieces

Game consists of 36 pieces. These are colored Pyramid pieces. They come in three different sizes (small, medium, and large) and four colors (red, blue, yellow, and green). There are 3 copies of each piece, resulting in 36 total pieces.

Pieces begin the game in the Bank, which stores all unused pieces. This limits which pieces are available for various actions in the game.

## Star Systems

Throughout the game, different Star Systems can be added to the game board. At the start each player selects a binary star system as their home system. Star systems are represented by a vertical pyramid (or two stacked for binary systems).

All Star Systems are connected to all other star systems of a different size than themselves. Binary star systems only connect to systems of the missing size.

## Ships

Players control star ships which must be located at a particular planet. These ships are represented by a pyramid lying flat and facing away from the player that controls it.

Ships can be activated to utilize a color power available in their system.

## Color Powers

### Build (Green)

Green power builds new ships in the system. Ships may activate the green power to construct a new ship of the same color as the Activating Ship. You must build the smallest ship of that color available in the bank.

### Travel (Yellow)

Yellow power moves ships to connected systems. It can also discover a new system by taking any piece from the Bank and placing it on the Star Field. Move your piece there.

Any star systems which have no ships at the end of the turn are immediately removed and returned to the Bank.

### Trade (Blue)

Blue power allows a ship to exchange itself for another ship of the same size of a different color (Even a color you don't have).

### Capture (Red)

Red power allows a ship to capture a hostile ship of equal or smaller size.

_Note_: That a larger ship can activate the red power from a smaller ship to capture a ship larger than the smaller red ship.

## Sacrifice

You may sacrifice a ship from anywhere on the board, granting a number of power actions of the color of that ship equal to the ship size. You may activate these actions from any ship in any system, even if that power is not available in that system.

## Catastrophy

At any time on your turn, you may declare a catastrophy on any system which has 4 or more pieces of the same color. All pieces of that color are destroyed and returned to the bank. If the star itself is destroyed then everything in the system is removed.

If a binary star system is damaged, only the matching color piece is removed, converting the system to a single star system. It takes two catastrophies to destroy a Binary Star System.

## Victory

Three paths to victory:

Direct Assault - Use Red ships to take control of all ships defending the Home Planet.
Fleet Catastrophy - Cause a catastrophy which destroys all ships around the Homeplanet, abandoning it.
Star Demolition - Cause two catastrophies to destroy both halves of the Home Star System.
